# WorkshopPLUS - Developing Applications with Containers
Developing Applications with Containers is a four-day immersive course with blend of instructor led training sessions followed by a Proof of Concept (PoC). This workshop takes the hands-on approach to cover designing, developing and deploying applications using containers targeting Linux and Windows platform. The workshop closes with a PoC presenting a real world “Lift and Shift” scenario for containerization of legacy applications.

## Target Audience

- Application architects
- Application developers

## Abstract

### Workshop

This workshop will help you meet today’s and tomorrow’s challenges by acquiring knowledge on Linux and Windows Containers. Understanding the “Containerization” process, using containers to design and develop Microservices, and Clustering & Orchestration Tools, including Kubernettes, Swarm and DC/OS. Implement Continuous Delivery for Containerized Applications using Azure DevOps. Lastly, you will learn about monitoring and troubleshooting containers. 

### Proof of Concept (POC)

The Proof of Concept (PoC) is based on a real world scenario that helps you understand the end-to-end containerization process of a legacy application (a.k.a Brown Field). During this PoC you lift and shift a canonical legacy 3-tier .NET 4.5 application to Windows containers platform.  This application consists of ASP.NET 4.5 MVC web application, .NET 4.5 based business/data layer and SQL Server. In addition, you will have a solid understanding of Linux and Windows containers, containerization process, monitoring and troubleshooting containers and microservices

### Hands-on Lab
